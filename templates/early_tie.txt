Both teams just farmed it out.
{teamone_member} and {teamtwo_member} agree to make a bro lane and just farm without trading.
Both teams picked safe lanes all around, nothing is really happening.
Riot servers crashed and no one was able to connect, 5 champions are chilling in each base.
Junglers steal each other's buffs and nothing comes out of it.
{teamone} is winning top but {teamtwo} is winning bot, will it be top or bot diff?
